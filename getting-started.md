## Getting Started With Neno

### Installing & setting up Neno

Neno is very easy to setup and only takes a few minutes to install. We have created a walkthrough guide below to to guide you through the process. 
##### Step 1 Select Source language.
The first thing you will be asked to do is to Select your source Language. This is the language you will use to translate from. If your website is already multilingual then choose the main language you create content in. We recommend that you select English as your source language whenever possible, as the quality of external machine translation is often better.

Once you have selected your source language click next to move to next step.

##### Step 2 Default Settings 
Here you can choose Your default Translation settings. When Neno discovers untranslated content on your site it will assign it to the translation method you select here. You can also select a second translation method; this can be useful if for example you select machine translation as the first method, and want to review the machine translations manually afterwards.These settings can easily be changed later. For now select the translation method you think you will use most.

##### Step 3 Target Languages
Here you can choose the target languages you wish to translate your website into. To choose a language simply click the published button to select it. (You may see some text in red saying that the language does not have a created content record, but don’t worry just click “Fix it!”)

You can add as many languages as you like here, and you can add or remove languages from your dashboard after setup is complete. You can also select your default translation method for the chosen languages here and change them later.

If You don’t see the language you are looking for you can click on the add language button at the bottom of the page to get more languages. Once you can see all your target languages have been installed on screen click next to continue.

##### Step 4 backup your site.
To complete the setup, neno needs to move any existing translations to the neno database, to prevent having to translate content again. At this point we recommend that you backup your site as once the content is removed there is no way to undo this action. Once your site is backed up click on the proceed button to complete the installation.

##### Step 5 Completing Setup.
Neno will now install automatically. This process takes around five minutes so feel free to get on with other tasks. Just don’t close this window! Once Neno has finished setting up you can use the navigation on the left to go to your dashboard.
 
### Introducing Your Neno Dashboard 

When you get to your dashboard you will get an overview of what target languages you have selected and how far you have progressed in translating your site into that language.

From the dashboard page you can do several things:
* Click on translate to begin or carry on translating your site into the target language.
* Add another target language by clicking on the Add language button.
* Buy Translation Credit (to use machine or professional translation)
* Configure your translation method for the target language by clicking on the configure button.
* Unpublish a target language (will be removed from website but will remain in dashboard should you wish to come back to it    later)
* Remove a language (Deletes the language permanently)
* Navigate to other Neno features.

##### Translate
This is the main workspace in Neno where all the translation gets done. Use the search bar at the top to easily find specific content you want to translate. Assign your translation method and begin translating. In the translation status drop down box You can toggle between translated and not translated strings to easily keep track of progress. In the groups and elements drop down box you can sort your strings by category to make them more manageable.

##### Groups & Elements
This view allows you to organise your content into groups and assign individual translation methods to each group. It also allows you to configure exactly what database fields in a table should be translated. Use the blue drop down arrows on the left to open a group, you can then choose what to translate and what not to by using the Translate/Don’t translate buttons to the right.

You may for example have some local content, such as an address, or local news that you do not want to translate. You can set this up easily by going to the content group and selecting don’t translate for that particular element. If you are using machine or professional translators, you can reduce costs considerably in this way.

##### External Translations
When you set Neno to translate something by machine or by a professional translator, Neno will show it on this screen and check to see if you have enough translation credit to perform the translation. If you don’t have enough, Neno will alert you and show the amount of translation credits (TC) needed. Once you have enough TC simply click order now and the translations will be automatically added to your site when complete.

##### Settings
###### General
In the general settings, you can enter a licence code that will enable you to order external translations. You can get a free licence from http://www.neno-translate.com If you have purchased a premium subscription please paste in your licence key to prevent inserting our backlink. 

As well as choosing the default translation method, you can specify which machine translation engine you wish to use, Google or Yandex. Translations by Google have better quality in general, except if the source or target language is Russian, where Yandex works better.
The API key box is only necessary for using the "Copy & translate" button on the Translation interface. To send content to google or yandex to be translated via external translations, there's no need to have an API key, all the process go through Neno.
You can find out how to get an API key for Google Translate here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP5-78V4EJI
You can find out how to get an API key for yandex here: https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1-XTgyT7ZM

###### Scheduled Tasks.
Here you can select which method you would like to use to perform scheduled tasks. We recommend Cron because there is a slight Performance benefit over Ajax. However cron does require additional Setup, and may not work on all servers, so unless you are an advanced user choose Ajax (Default Setting) to avoid any issues.

##### Debug Report
Neno will log information about every action it takes. In the unlikely event of an error, the report can be copied and sent to the Neno support team to help them resolve the problem quickly. 

##### A Few Things To Remember:
* Check out our FAQ page if you have any questions that are not answered here. You can also look for help in our community     forum and for premium members there is a ticket system. 

* If you can’t find the content you are looking for to translate, try typing some of the text into the search box.

*If you want to use the copy and translate button on the translation interface (for machine translations) you will need to    get an API key(Google or Yandex) first and copy and paste it into the box provided on the settings page.
